# README - ActualBudget.com Review 2022-04

*Contents*


## This is an Obsidian Vault
Please clone the repo then open it using the wonderful Obsidian Knowledge Management Tool at https://www.obsidian.md/.


> [!hint] Obsidian Download #free
> 
> [Obsidian.md - A second brain, for you, forever.](https://obsidian.md/)


Like your project, Obsidian's core strength is that all vaults are stored in local markdown files.

> [!question] 
> *Curious if you were inspired by Obsidian for local data? Hacked?*


### Git Repo
- Created on GitHub since most people/projects/open source lovers seem to live there.
- I actually like the idea of Bitbucket, since I run [my DevOps contracting company](https://www.dalyle.ca) off the Atlassian suite, primarily using [[Jira Customer Service Management]].
- Holy smokes, Jira Customer Service could really help field people into this properly.
	- Dude....
	- Only reason I think you would be open is that I saw the Trello Board for requests/roadmap/issues.
- Anywhere I use #RX., or just `RX` w/o hashtag, it means `Recommendation`.
- I have strong opinions, but they change within microseconds, agile, pragmatic, feelings not hurt.
	- A lot of what I say may be #n00b not seeing/knowing what's going on, like just now seing your `app.ActualBudget.com` domain 👍.
- On the flip-side of that, please don't take anything I say in here personally, with offense, or feeling judged.
	- This all started with my raw notes, meant for me, and I am not cleaning them since then my perfectionism will take over and I will NEVER send this to you.
		- Just more text on my hard drive doing nothing 😢.


### Images/Attachments May Be Broken
- Started as a sub-folder of my main "daily-notes" Obsidian Vault.
- Therefore some pasted images may not be in the new sub folder that the git repo is based on.
- I will be cleaning it all up and adding some preferred `/.obsidian/` settings, plugins, etc.
	- Missing b/c of the sub-folder thing.

## Hi James 👋
Hello Good Sir James,

> *(jk about the Good Sir, I am not a spammer, I am watching the Green Knight on Amazon right now, chopped into 15 min pieces, like my mind/day/workflow/attention flows)*

> *Although, GitHub repo spam would be a new one..., ewww.*


Sorry if I am stepping on toes.

I came across your reddit posts, thankfully, and finally, today (2022-04-28).

Since then, oh my, nearly four hours ago now, I have been putting together notes, like I have been doing for other apps, but in FAR greater detail than usual.

That must mean I like this/you. That my 💘 feels something.

This is a bit more than haphazard, but I felt I should share, since I wanted to ask what #ProjectManagement or #KnowledgeManagement tools you prefer, so I can put items into it.

Appears you are using [Trello](link?) nicely for managing `Incoming` work, *(love the column name btw, I use it myself all the time but wasn't sure if others did)*.

I am going to keep my notes in here, this [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) vault, using a community member created `"plugin"` for [Kanban Boards](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban).

Please get in touch, I am going to continue anyways, as this has greatly helped me refine what I am looking for in a #FinancialManagementTool / Suite.


Very well done, and deserved name, Good Sir James! 🎉🙏


Some of my random notes below.


- What almost dis-sold me was seeing the demo reports.
- Only 2?!
- I realize now though you know this, you created a whole freaking query language to support his.
- That is where I want to go.
	- Querying my data, for reports I can create
	- I can share my custom reports
		- I can feel like I am investing time in reports, to share with others, for cred or not, but who doesn't want a little cred deep down inside?!
		- **Reports/Add-ons/Extensions Marketplace** *( #WhatTerminology do you prefer?)* in mind?
			- Cool to be GitHub (or Bitubcket b/c of Trello) repo powered like https://winget.run, ), etc.
			- Let people fork the repo, add their extension, and issue a pull request.
	- 
- 
- My data, but cloud synced because, come on, I am lazy and don't want to do that myself, plus I think your distributed security sounds right on the money (ha, haha, I'm a Dad, I get to make puns).
